From the lender's perspective, credit risk could disrupt its cash flows or increase collection costs, since the lender may be forced to hire a debt collection agency to enforce the collection. The loss may be partial or complete, where the lender incurs a loss of part of the loan or the entire loan extended to the borrower.\n","\n","Credit scoring algorithms, which calculate the probability of default, are the best methods that banks use to determine whether or not a loan should be granted. \n","\n","In order to build a credit scoring system, the following feature transformations are performed:\n","\n","#### Weight of Evidence and Information value\n","\n","Logistic regression is a commonly used technique in credit scoring for solving binary classification problems. Prior to model fitting, another iteration of variable selection is valuable to check if the newly WOE transformed variables are still good model candidates. Preferred candidate variables are those with higher information value having a linear relationship with the dependent variable, have good coverage across all categories, have a normal distribution, contain a notable overall contribution, and are relevant to the business.\n","\n","**Weight of evidence** (WOE) is a powerful tool for feature representation and evaluation in data science. WOE can provide interpret able transformation to both categorical and numerical features. The weight of evidence tells the predictive power of an independent variable in relation to the dependent variable. Since it evolved from credit scoring world, it is generally described as a measure of the separation of good and bad customers. \"Bad Customers\" refers to the customers who defaulted on a loan. and \"Good Customers\" refers to the customers who paid back loan. WOE can be calculated using the below formula:\n","\n","$$WOE = ln \\left( \\frac{\\%   of  Non\\_Events}{\\%   of  Events} \\right)$$\n","\n","Steps to calculate WOE\n","* For a continuous variable, split data into 10 parts (or lesser depending on the distribution).\n","* Calculate the number of events and non-events in each group (bin)\n","* Calculate the % of events and % of non-events in each group.\n","* Calculate WOE by taking natural log of division of % of non-events and % of events\n","\n","**Information value** is one of the most useful technique to select important variables in a predictive model. It helps to rank variables on the basis of their importance.
